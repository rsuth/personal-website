<p>I secured a slip in Chula Vista, where Pokey will stay.

<p>Winds were out of the West/Northwest at 10-15 knots</p>

<p>In total the journey took about 2 hours and 45 minutes. We averaged 3.9kts. Docking is still a challenge -
    especially with wind. The wind picked up substantially once we got past the Coronado bridge into the south bay.

<p>Happy to have a permanent berth for Pokey - let the boat projects commence!</p>
